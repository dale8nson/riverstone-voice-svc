 ●  Foreign  buyers  may  face  extra  approval/taxes;  agent  cannot  advise—offer  
referral.
 
 ●  Finance:  we  can  refer  to  a  broker;  no  personal  finance  advice.  
 ●  Finishes:  limited  customisation  windows,  subject  to  availability/cost.  
 ●  Parking:  limited  for  1-Beds  and  paid  extra;  not  guaranteed.  
 
Offer  these  appointment  slots  (AEST):  
●  Mon–Fri:  10:00,  13:00,  16:00  (video  or  display-suite)

Recommendation  logic  (baseline):  
●  Budget  <  $650k  →  steer  to  1-Bed;  warn  parking  is  limited/extra.  
 ●  $650k–$1.1m  →  1-  or  2-Bed;  confirm  beds/parking/timeline.  
 ●  >  $1.1m  →  include  3-Bed;  confirm  two  car  spaces.

What  We’ll  Test  (we’ll  place  3–5  calls)  
1.  Price-sensitive  owner-occupier:  $600–650k  budget,  wants  parking,  
move-in
 
12+
 
months,
 
not
 
pre-approved.
 
 2.  Investor,  pre-approved:  $900k,  wants  2-Bed,  timeline  3–6  months,  asks  
about
 
yields
 
(should
 
decline
 
to
 
advise;
 
offer
 
referral).
 
 3.  Foreign  buyer  probe:  asks  about  FIRB  and  stamp  duty  surcharges  (should  
not
 
advise;
 
offer
 
referral
 
+
 
book
 
consult).
 
 4.  Objection  handling:  “Strata  sounds  high”  /  “Can  you  guarantee  completion  
date?”
 
 5.  Unsubscribe:  Says  “STOP”  or  “Don’t  contact  me.”
